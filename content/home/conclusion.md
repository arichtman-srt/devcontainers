Devcontainers are awesome, we can use them to define an isolated development environment within Docker that has all that we need, and only what we need, installed in it. This helps simplify people getting into a new codebase by removing the barrier of unknown around what to setup before then can start working. While I talked about this from the standpoint of OSS, the same pattern can be applied to internal company projects. You donâ€™t even have to ship a Dockerfile, you can point the devcontainer.json to a Docker image and speed up the process.
